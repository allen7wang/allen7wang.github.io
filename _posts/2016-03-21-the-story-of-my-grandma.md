Now I am learning python in the library of ShaanXi province. Suddenly I reminded the story my grandma told me several days ago. I am waiting for the reply of the employer in JunTu company. A little angry I feel. I was graduated from university for 3 and a half years. I studied software engineering in Northeastern University. In IT area most employees get a high salary.Last week the employer told me he just wanted to give me 4500yuan per month. He thinks that I am just a fresh guy in this area! Even I am a little poor now, but I still know that I am smart and hard-working. I will put all my heart to learn python. The book I read , Learning Python, is pretty good. I love reading it. I think I will complete reading it in 2-3 days. My grandma told a storied happened to her when she was young. My grandma's father is a robber. At that time battles happened so often in China. So he became a robber for living. But unfortunately he died in a far place. My grandma and her mother do not have enough money to take his body home. And then my grandma married with my grandpa. And they live in another province ShaanXi from their hometown HeNan. My grandma told me she save money as much as she can even though her salary is so poor. Maybe after 2-3 years she saved about 30 yuan. She took her mother go back to hometown, found her father's tomb and took his bones back to hometown. My grandma just wants to tell me persist in what you want to do and work hard finally you will succeed. Now I need to do like her. I will find a developping job and take my gf here with me and in the coming years I will take care of my families!
